# Agile Ceremonies Reflection

## Reflection

### How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment
Agile ceremonies keep everyone on the same page. Stand-ups give quick daily updates so we all know what’s in progress, what’s blocked, and what’s next. Retrospectives give us space to reflect on what’s working and what’s not, so we can improve together. Backlog refinement and prioritisation make sure we’re always working on the most important things. These regular touchpoints mean fewer surprises and better teamwork.

### Most Important Ceremony for My Role
For me as a UX designer, backlog refinement (or continuous prioritisation in Kanban) is the most important. It’s where I can bring in design requirements, make sure user experience considerations are accounted for early, and align with developers and PMs on what’s coming next. Being involved here means fewer last-minute design scrambles.

### One Change to Improve Team Collaboration
I can start sharing short design context notes before stand-ups or refinement sessions. This way, the team has the background before we talk, which can make discussions quicker and more productive—especially for those working in different time zones.

### Additional Evidence: Stand-up and Retrospective Participation

I attended the HireUp user testing stand-up session.  
During this meeting, each team member (divided into groups) gave short updates about the user testing progress, shared key observations, and mentioned any blockers.  
I helped capture user feedback, wrote down participants' comments, and later organized them into categories to support the analysis phase.  
It was helpful to see how quick daily syncs keep everyone aligned and ensure design, testing, and development stay connected.

I also reviewed notes from a past retrospective, where the team discussed what went well and what could be improved.  
It showed how small communication adjustments—like clearer task ownership—can improve collaboration in future sprints.
