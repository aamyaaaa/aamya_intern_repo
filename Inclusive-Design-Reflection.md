# Inclusive Design Reflection

## Reflection

### Adjusting My Communication Style
To be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates, I can focus on keeping my communication clear, concise, and free of unnecessary jargon. Breaking down instructions into smaller, manageable steps and avoiding overwhelming people with too much information at once will make it easier for them to engage. I can also give extra context where needed and check in to confirm understanding without making it feel like a test.

### Common Pitfalls That Can Make Focus Bear Less Accessible
Some pitfalls to watch out for include overloading screens with too many options, using vague labels that require extra mental effort to decode, or adding unnecessary animations and sounds that can be distracting or overwhelming. On the communication side, assuming everyone processes information the same way can lead to misunderstandings or frustration.

### One Practical Change I Can Make
One simple change I can make is to ensure every design or message I create has a “low cognitive load” version—something stripped of clutter, written in plain language, and easy to follow at a glance. This would give neurodivergent users a calmer and more predictable experience.
### Insight from a First-Person Account

I read the article “https://laconciergepsychologist.com/blog/audhd-autism-and-adhd/” from LA Concierge Psychologist.  
It explains how people with both ADHD and Autism (AuDHD) experience constant internal conflict—craving novelty like ADHDers but also needing predictability like autistic individuals. This tug-of-war often leads to burnout, frustration, and difficulties maintaining routines.  
The article highlighted that digital tools can easily overwhelm AuDHD users if they include too much sensory input, unclear navigation, or frequent changes. It reminded me that Focus Bear should provide a calm, structured, and low-stimulation environment that supports both flexibility and routine.

### Supportive Response Example
If a user with AuDHD wrote in saying they felt frustrated about not keeping up with their routines, I would respond like this:

> Hi there, thank you for reaching out and sharing how you’re feeling. It’s completely okay to find routines hard to maintain.  
> Many people with ADHD or Autism experience this same cycle of motivation and burnout, especially when balancing focus, energy, and structure.  
> You might find it helpful to simplify your schedule in Focus Bear. Maybe start with one small routine and build from there instead of trying to do everything at once.  
> Remember, progress doesn’t have to be perfect. Even small, consistent steps count. You’re already doing great by reaching out and reflecting on what works best for you.
