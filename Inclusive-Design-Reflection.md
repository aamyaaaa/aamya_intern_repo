# Inclusive Design Reflection

## Reflection

### Adjusting My Communication Style
To be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates, I can focus on keeping my communication clear, concise, and free of unnecessary jargon. Breaking down instructions into smaller, manageable steps and avoiding overwhelming people with too much information at once will make it easier for them to engage. I can also give extra context where needed and check in to confirm understanding without making it feel like a test.

### Common Pitfalls That Can Make Focus Bear Less Accessible
Some pitfalls to watch out for include overloading screens with too many options, using vague labels that require extra mental effort to decode, or adding unnecessary animations and sounds that can be distracting or overwhelming. On the communication side, assuming everyone processes information the same way can lead to misunderstandings or frustration.

### One Practical Change I Can Make
One simple change I can make is to ensure every design or message I create has a “low cognitive load” version—something stripped of clutter, written in plain language, and easy to follow at a glance. This would give neurodivergent users a calmer and more predictable experience.
