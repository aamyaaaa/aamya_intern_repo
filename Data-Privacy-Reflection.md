# Data Privacy Reflection

## Reflection

### Steps I Can Take to Handle Data Securely
I will make sure that any sensitive files or documents I work with are stored only in approved, secure locations (e.g., company cloud storage, not personal drives). I’ll avoid downloading confidential data unless it’s absolutely necessary, and I’ll delete local copies once I’m done.

### Storing, Sharing, and Disposing of Sensitive Information
I’ll store sensitive data in encrypted or password-protected systems. If I need to share it, I’ll use secure channels only and never send it through unsecured messaging apps or personal email. When disposing of files, I’ll ensure they are permanently deleted, not just moved to the trash.

### Common Mistakes That Cause Privacy Issues (and How to Avoid Them)
- **Using weak passwords** → Use strong, unique passwords and a password manager.
- **Leaving devices unlocked** → Always lock my laptop/phone when away from my desk.
- **Sharing sensitive info over unsecured channels** → Stick to approved, secure communication tools.
- **Clicking suspicious links** → Double-check sources before clicking, especially if the link is unexpected.

### Habit I’ll Adopt to Improve Data Security
I’ll make a habit of locking my computer every single time I step away from it, even for just a minute.

### Key Learning
Data privacy isn’t just about avoiding big mistakes—it’s about building small, consistent habits that keep sensitive information safe every day.
