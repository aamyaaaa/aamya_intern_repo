# Cyber Security Guidelines Reflection

## Reflection

### Current Security Measures and Where I Can Improve
Right now, I already use strong passwords for most accounts, and I’m careful about avoiding suspicious links or downloads. I also have 2FA enabled on a few key accounts. Where I can improve is making sure 2FA is turned on for *all* work-related accounts and being more consistent about using a password manager instead of storing passwords in my head or browser.

### Making Secure Behaviour a Habit
Security becomes second nature when it’s part of my daily routine. For example, I can get into the habit of locking my computer every time I step away, even if it’s just for a minute. I can also set a calendar reminder to review account security settings regularly, so I’m not only reacting when something goes wrong.

### Steps to Keep Passwords and Accounts Secure
I’ll make sure every password I use is unique, long, and hard to guess—ideally generated by a password manager. I’ll also enable 2FA wherever it’s available. This way, even if a password is compromised, there’s still another layer of protection.

### What I’d Do if I Suspected a Breach
If I noticed suspicious activity or thought my account might be compromised, I’d immediately change my password, enable (or re-enable) 2FA, and report the issue to the relevant contact at Focus Bear. Acting fast reduces the damage and helps keep the rest of the team safe.

### One New Cyber Security Habit I’ll Follow
From now on, I’ll always lock my computer the moment I step away from my desk, no matter how short the break.
