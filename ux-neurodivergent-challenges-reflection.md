# UX Neurodivergent Challenges Reflection – Focus Bear

## Reflection

### Making Tasks Easier for Neurodivergent Users
Focus Bear’s design should guide users step-by-step, showing only what’s needed in the moment. For someone with ADHD or Autism, a cluttered screen can be mentally exhausting, so keeping things clean, predictable, and clearly labelled helps them stay focused and feel in control. Simple navigation, clear feedback after each action, and no unnecessary noise in the interface can make all the difference.

### Redesigning Overwhelming but Useful Features
If a feature is technically valuable but feels overwhelming, it needs to be broken down. That might mean introducing it in smaller parts, hiding advanced options behind “expand” buttons, or using progressive disclosure so the user only sees complexity when they choose to. The goal is to keep the usefulness while removing the mental weight.

### Small Adjustments with a Big Impact
Even small tweaks can have a huge effect for neurodivergent users. Things like consistent button placement, clear headings, and short, direct language make the interface easier to navigate. Adjustable font sizes, simple animations instead of flashy ones, and the option to reduce visual clutter can all help create a calmer, more user-friendly space.
