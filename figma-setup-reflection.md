## Figma Setup
### Organising a Design System in Figma
I would create a dedicated design system file that has all the essentials—brand colours, typography, spacing rules, and reusable components like buttons, input fields, and icons. Clear naming is key, so instead of “Button1,” I’d name it “Button / Primary / Default.” This file would be published as a library so any team project can pull from it, keeping everything consistent.

### Providing Details About a Component to Developers
If a developer needed details, I will guide them to the component in Figma and ask them to switch to Inspect mode. I’d make sure the layers are clearly named and add notes explaining behaviour, states, and edge cases. If it’s an interactive element, I’d link them to the prototype so they can see it in action.


### Challenges in Collaborating on Figma and How to Avoid Them
One challenge is when multiple people make big changes at the same time—it can get messy. To avoid this, I’d suggest having one person “own” certain sections or using version history to manage edits. Another issue is inconsistent component use, which is why sticking to a shared design system is so important. Miscommunication can also happen, so I can always pair a Figma handoff with a quick conversation to make sure everyone’s on the same page.
