# UX Usability Test Report – Focus Bear

**Tester Profile:**  
A student aiming to build consistent study habits. Has a late-night schedule (typically sleeps around 2 AM).  

**Test Scenario:**  
First-time use of Focus Bear, setting up a focus session to work without distractions. Tester was asked to think out loud during the process.

## What was the easiest part of setting up the session?
'Locking apps was surprisingly easy'. the tester expected it to be complicated but found it straightforward and quick. This created a positive first impression.

## Was anything confusing or unclear?
The 'Build a routine or study session' question in the onboarding was ambiguous.  
The tester was unsure if they had to choose one option or if both could be selected. This caused a brief pause in the setup flow.

## Did you feel like you always knew what to do next?
Yes. The tester reported feeling confident about what to do after each step, apart from the routine/study session choice. The process felt guided and intuitive.

## How did the design make you feel while using it?
Engaging and motivating. The design elements gave a sense of progress, making the experience feel rewarding rather than tedious.

## If you could change one thing about the process, what would it be?
Add the ability to create routines that start late at night (e.g., after 2 AM). This would better accommodate night owls or students with unconventional schedules.

## Key Observations
- The app locking flow is a strong feature and works as expected.
- Early setup questions could benefit from more clarity to prevent hesitation.
- Scheduling flexibility is limited for late-night users.

## Recommendations
1. Clarify Choices – Add a short note explaining if whether both study session or build a routine could be selected.  
2. Expand Scheduling – Allow focus sessions and routines to start at any hour, including late-night start times.  
3. Keep the Momentum – Preserve the smooth and simple app locking experience in future updates.

## Summary
Overall, the tester found Focus Bear easy to use, engaging, and effective at its core purpose. A few adjustments to clarity and scheduling flexibility would make the onboarding experience even better, especially for users with unconventional work or study hours.
