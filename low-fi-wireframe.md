# Music Player Design

## Summary
My task as discussed was to add music functionality to the App.

## Design Process
- **Paper Prototypes (7 options):** Explored layouts for controls and mini-player and converted all into figma protoypes.  
- **Low-Fidelity Wireframe:** Refined chosen layout in Figma.  
- **High-Fidelity (3 Iterations):** Refined icons, spacing, and feedback. Final version approved after voting and supervisor review.

## Final Improvements
- refined the positioning of the music player option.
- Also refined the view of the playlist
