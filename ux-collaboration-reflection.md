# UX Collaboration Reflection – Focus Bear

## Reflection

### Ensuring a Smooth Handoff Between Design and Development
A smooth handoff starts with clarity. That means providing developers with well-structured Figma files, clear notes, and explanations for why certain decisions were made. It is also about being available to answer questions quickly. Regular check-ins during implementation can catch small issues as well.

### Handling Conflicting Priorities Between Teams
It’s normal for design, development, and product to see things from different angles. When priorities clash, the best approach is open discussion focused on the shared goal: what’s best for the user. Sometimes that means compromising on scope, timing, or polish, but never at the cost of completely losing the core user experience.

### Responding to Developer Modifications
If a developer changes a design because of technical limitations, my first step would be to understand the constraint. Is it a timeline issue, a platform restriction, or something else? Once I know that, I’d work with them to find the closest possible alternative that still preserves the user’s needs. The goal isn’t to fight for a pixel-perfect match, but to protect the intent of the design while staying realistic about what can be built.
