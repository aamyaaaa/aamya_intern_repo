## Reflection

### Documenting User Testing Results
If I conducted a user testing session, I’d start with the purpose and goals of the test, then summarise the method (how many participants, what tasks they completed, how it was moderated).  
Next, I’d include key observations—both successes and pain points—and add direct quotes from participants to make the feedback feel real. Finally, I’d wrap up with recommendations, linking them to the problems we observed.


### Preventing Miscommunication Between Teams
A well-structured UX document acts as a shared reference point. It keeps everyone—from developers to product managers—aligned on the goals, reasoning, and expected outcomes. Instead of relying on memory or informal chats, teams can check the document to clarify what was agreed upon and why. This reduces guesswork and avoids rework.


### Challenges in Writing UX Documentation and How to Avoid Them
One challenge is writing too much or too little—too much detail can overwhelm people, but too little leaves gaps. To avoid this, I’d focus on clarity and relevance.  
Another challenge is keeping documentation updated as designs evolve. I’d make it a habit to review and update documents regularly, especially after key design changes or testing rounds.  
Finally, sometimes teams don’t read the documentation at all. To encourage engagement, I’d keep the format clean, visual where possible, and share key highlights in meetings to make sure the most important points are heard.
