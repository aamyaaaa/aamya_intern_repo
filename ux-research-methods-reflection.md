# UX Research Methods Reflection

## Reflection

### Improving Focus Bear’s Onboarding Experience
To improve onboarding, I’d start with usability testing to watch how new users go through the process and spot where they get stuck. I’d also run short interviews to hear their first impressions and send a quick survey afterward to gather more feedback at scale. Combining observation with direct feedback would give a full picture of what’s working and what’s not.

### Challenges with Self-Reported Feedback
The main challenge is bias—people might say what they think you want to hear, or they might forget details about their experience. Sometimes they also can’t explain their struggles clearly. That’s why self-reported feedback should be combined with observation.

### Avoiding Bias in Research
As a researcher, I’d stay neutral in tone and wording, making sure my questions don’t hint at a “right” answer. I’d also let people complete tasks without jumping in too quickly, even if they struggle, so I can see their real behaviour without influencing them.
