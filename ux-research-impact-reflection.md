# UX Research Impact Reflection

## Reflection

### When Research Contradicts Personal Preference
If the research says something different from what I personally like, I’d go with the research. It’s not about my taste—it’s about what works best for the people using the product. I wouldn’t take it personally because the goal is to create something that helps users, not to satisfy my own design style.

### Keeping Work Aligned with Real User Needs
The easiest way to stay on track is to actually talk to the people who will use the product. I’d run surveys, ask questions, and test ideas with the target group before making big design decisions. That way, I’m not just guessing—I’m building based on real feedback.

### Risks of Designing Based on Assumptions
If I rely only on my own assumptions, I could completely miss what users actually need. All that work could end up being useless if it doesn’t solve their real problems. Research saves time, avoids big mistakes, and makes sure the final design actually works in real life.
