# User Manual

## What I Need from Teammates
I work best when I have flexibility in how I approach tasks and access to all the resources I need before I start. I also appreciate having enough time to fully understand the problem before diving into execution—this helps me produce better, more thoughtful work.

## How I Prefer to Communicate
I’m more than happy with video calls because they make it easier to understand and clarify things in real time. If it’s more about reporting or status updates, email check-ins work well for me so there’s a written record to refer back to.

## What Helps Me Stay Focused and Productive
Lately, Focus Bear has been helping me stay in the zone, but I need the right environment to get into deep focus. That could be a quiet day at home or a buzzing café—it’s less about silence and more about finding the right energy to keep me going.

## How I Like to Give and Receive Feedback
Any form of feedback works for me, but I slightly prefer verbal feedback because it allows me to ask questions and understand the reasoning better in the moment.

## Quirks About My Work Style
I brainstorm out loud and like having a bit of time beforehand to understand the topic we’ll be brainstorming about. I also enjoy working in environments with people around—like a café—because it gives me energy and keeps me engaged.
