# User Manual for Aamya

## My Role
I am working on UX design and related tasks that make Focus Bear intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable to use.

## I am working on..
Designing and refining user experiences, collaborating with developers, and ensuring design decisions align with user needs and accessibility standards.

## The days and times I work are:
I generally work on:
- Saturdays (9am- 1pm)
- Sundays(9am- 1pm)
- Monday (9am- 11am)

## How I Work Best
I do my best work when I have flexibility in how I approach tasks, access to all the resources I need before starting, and enough time to fully understand the problem before execution.  
I struggle when I’m rushed into starting without context or when priorities change mid-task without clear communication.

## Communication Style
I prefer messages to be clear and direct, with enough detail so I don’t have to guess the context.  
The best way to reach me is via video calls for discussions and email check-ins for reporting or detailed updates.  
If you need something urgent, call or ping me directly on our main communication channel so I see it immediately.

## Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when everyone shares updates openly and resources are available upfront.  
My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is unclear expectations or missing information that delays progress.  
If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I’m taking time to process the discussion before contributing.

## Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by getting into the “zone,” whether that’s at home or in a lively café. Tools like Focus Bear help me stay on track.  
Things that distract me include social media, frequent interruptions or unclear priorities.  
The best way to support my productivity is to let me work through deep focus sessions without breaking my flow.

## Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be direct, ideally verbal, so I can ask follow-up questions and understand the reasoning right away.  
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to explain what happened and what needs to change, without rushing the conversation.  
I appreciate it when teammates give context, share ideas openly, and collaborate on solutions rather than just pointing out problems.

## Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is that my preference for working in cafés isn’t about distraction—it actually helps me focus.  
A fun fact about me is that I often brainstorm out loud and love bouncing ideas around with others.  
My work superpower is turning big, messy ideas into clear, user-friendly designs.
