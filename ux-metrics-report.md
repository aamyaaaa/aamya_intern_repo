## Reflection

**If a UX metric shows poor user engagement, how would you determine the cause?**  
1. Review session recordings to observe actual behavior.  
2. Conduct user interviews or surveys to gather context.  
3. Check whether the drop correlates with a recent UI change or technical issue.  
4. Compare engagement by segment (new vs. returning users, device type).

**Risks of relying too much on numbers:**  
- Metrics can mislead if taken out of context (e.g., longer time on task could mean confusion, not deeper engagement).  
- Ignoring qualitative insights may lead to fixing symptoms instead of root causes.  

**Using metrics to convince stakeholders:**  
- Present before/after comparisons showing improvement.  
- Link usability issues to business KPIs (conversion, retention, support costs).  
- Use visual evidence (charts, graphs, recordings) to make the case more persuasive.
