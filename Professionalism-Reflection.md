# Professionalism Reflection

## Reflection

### Great Teamwork & Professionalism I’ve Seen
Yes, I’ve experienced teamwork where everyone openly shared updates, supported each other during challenges, and respected different working styles. What made it effective was trust, clear communication, no judgements and the willingness to help without being asked.

### Steps for Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication
I can slow down and think before sending messages, making sure my tone is constructive and inclusive. I’ll avoid assumptions, ask clarifying questions if I’m unsure, and be mindful of how my words might be interpreted in a remote setting.

### Creating a Positive, Fun, and Professional Environment
I can contribute by keeping the vibe friendly, using humour where appropriate, and celebrating wins—big or small. I’ll also make sure to step in respectfully if I see misunderstandings or conflict brewing, so they don’t escalate.

### Preparing for Meetings
Before meetings, I’ll review relevant documents, note down questions, and have any materials ready to share. This way, I can contribute meaningfully instead of scrambling for information during the call.

### Being Proactive During My Internship
I can take initiative by looking for areas where I can help without waiting to be told. This might mean suggesting ideas, flagging potential issues early, or checking in on tasks before deadlines approach.

### Following Up with Colleagues or Supervisors
If I need information or action from someone, I’ll follow up politely after a reasonable amount of time. If I still don’t get a response and it’s urgent or important, I’ll escalate it—first to a direct supervisor, and if needed, further up the chain. I’ll only escalate when it’s blocking my work or poses a bigger risk.

### Things I Won’t Do
I won’t engage in gossip, disrespect teammates, ignore messages, or allow frustration to turn into unprofessional behaviour. I also won’t sit on problems silently—if something’s wrong, I’ll raise it constructively.
