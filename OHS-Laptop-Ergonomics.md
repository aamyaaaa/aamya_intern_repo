# OHS – Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## Reflection

### Equipment Changes I Can Make
My setup is already pretty ergonomic—I use a monitor, external keyboard, mouse, and a laptop stand to keep my screen at eye level. Recently, I added a cushion to my chair for extra comfort and better back support, which has made a noticeable difference.

### Behavioural Changes for Better Posture & Less Strain
Even with a good setup, I still need to be mindful of my posture—sitting upright, keeping my shoulders relaxed, and making sure my feet are flat on the floor. I plan to take regular breaks (every 45–60 minutes) to stretch, walk, and reset my posture.

### Reminding Myself to Keep Good Habits
I’ll use Focus Bear’s movement reminders to make sure I step away from my desk regularly. I can also do quick posture checks when I start a task and after every break.

### Workspace Change I’ve Made
The cushion for my chair has improved my comfort and helped me maintain better posture during long work sessions.
