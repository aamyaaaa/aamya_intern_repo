## 1. What makes Focus Bear different?
While providing blocks and routine following, Focus Bear remains minimalistic and simple to navigate. Besides this, FocusBear also backs up the features with scienetific research which starts with making the mornings right and building up the productive day.
## 2. Why choose Focus Bear over competitors?
If I were a user, I would choose Focus Bear becasue it covers it all- From getting the mornings and evenings right to blocking social media and also helping get into deep focus. The other application do provide these features but no app provides it all while still keeping it all simple. The other things that stands out is having a bear for emaotional support. 
## 3. One feature others have that Focus Bear doesn't
- Freedom: Various music options for focus session 
- Cold Turkey: More advanced blocking options ( eg: Blocking a specific youtube channel)
- Tiimo: Calender Integartion, To-do list 
- Routinery: Widgets for achievements (iOS)
## 4. One improvement for Focus Bear
Add in the calender and To-Do list feature that helps prioritize the tasks
