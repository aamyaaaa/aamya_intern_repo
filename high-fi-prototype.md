## Design Overview
The high-fidelity prototype builds upon the final low-fidelity structure, focusing on refined visuals, typography, and interaction design. It incorporates Focus Bear’s brand-inspired colour palette, rounded UI elements, and smooth transitions to create a calm and engaging experience for users.


## Key Design Enhancements
- **Color System:** Updated to a cohesive palette inspired by Focus Bear’s branding — soft blues and neutrals to reduce cognitive overload.  
- **Typography:** Used clean, legible sans-serif fonts for clarity and accessibility.  
- **Spacing:** Added consistent padding and margins to create a balanced, uncluttered interface.  
- **Button States & Interactions:** Introduced hover and tap states for key actions like *Play*, *Pause*, and *Add to Playlist* to improve usability feedback.  
- **Animations:** Implemented smooth micro-interactions to make transitions between screens more intuitive and fluid.  


## Feedback & Iterations
### Iteration 1
- **Feedback:** Colours and rounding of elements felt slightly inconsistent.  
- **Action:** Adjusted primary shades and border radius for uniformity.  

### Iteration 2
- **Feedback:** The layout appeared too structured.  
- **Action:** Increased breathing space and softened visual hierarchy for a more natural look.  

### Iteration 3
- **Feedback:** Some interface elements were unnecessary.  
- **Action:** Removed redundant icons and left-aligned the playlist to enhance readability and focus.  


## Supervisor & Founder Review
Both **supervisor** and **founder** reviewed the high-fidelity prototype. They appreciated the visual consistency, smoother interactions, and overall refinement achieved after multiple iterations.


## Reflection
Creating the high-fidelity prototype helped bridge the gap between concept and reality. The added details in color, spacing, and motion made the design more engaging and developer ready.  
Small touches like button transitions and responsive states improved clarity, feedback, and overall user satisfaction.
