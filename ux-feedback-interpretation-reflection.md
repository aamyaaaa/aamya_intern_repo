# UX Feedback Interpretation Reflection

## Reflection

### Handling Mixed Feedback
If one person dislikes a feature but most others like it, I wouldn’t rush to remove it. Instead, I’d look into why that one person had an issue—maybe it’s a specific edge case that can be fixed without losing the feature for everyone else. Popularity matters, but understanding outliers is important too.

### Using Patterns in Feedback
When the same comment or complaint comes up from multiple people, that’s a strong sign it’s a real UX problem. Patterns help separate one-off opinions from issues that actually affect a lot of users.

### Risks of Acting on Limited Feedback
If I make changes based on only one or two comments, I might end up “fixing” something that wasn’t broken. That can waste time, confuse users, or even make the experience worse. Feedback should be verified and supported by more than just a small sample before major changes are made.
