# Reflection: Introduction to Wireframing and When to Use It

## Why Start with Wireframes
Starting with wireframes lets me focus on the structure and functionality of a design without getting distracted by fonts, colours, or imagery. It’s a fast, low-cost way to explore ideas and test layouts before committing significant time to high-fidelity work. This saves effort if changes are needed, which is almost always the case in the early stages.

## Spotting Usability Issues Early
Wireframes make it easier to identify problems with navigation, flow, or content placement before visual design complicates things. By keeping the design simple, I can quickly spot if users might get confused or if key actions are buried.

## Explaining the Value to Stakeholders
If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, I’d explain that wireframes are like the blueprint. They help us get alignment on the foundation before spending extra time and resources on visual polish. This ultimately makes the process faster, cheaper, and more user-focused.
