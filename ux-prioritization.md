# UX Prioritization Proposal

## Reflection – Working with PMs to Prioritize UX

If a PM told me there’s no time for a UX improvement, I wouldn’t just drop it and move on. I’d first try to understand why first. Maybe it’s a tight deadline, maybe there’s a higher priority feature. If it’s a matter of scope, I’d suggest a smaller version of the change or a quick win that could still help users without slowing the team down. And if it truly can’t fit now, I’d make sure it’s documented so we can revisit it later.

I think the key to making sure usability issues don’t get ignored is to show why they matter in real terms. Not just “this would be nicer,” but “this will save users time” or “this could reduce support requests.” Pairing actual user feedback or usability testing clips with business metrics is powerful. It’s harder to ignore a problem when you can see a frustrated user struggling.

To get UX seen as a business priority, I’d talk about the return on investment. Better UX often means happier users, higher retention, fewer complaints, and sometimes even more revenue. Framing it in those terms and showing examples of competitors doing it well helps shift the conversation from “nice-to-have” to “we can’t afford not to.”

Overall, I’d keep collaboration open and friendly. PMs have to juggle a lot, and if I can position UX work as something that makes their life easier and the product stronger, we’ll be on the same side.
