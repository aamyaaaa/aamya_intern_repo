# AI Usage Guidelines Reflection

## Reflection

### When to Use AI vs. My Own Skills
I would use AI when I need help brainstorming ideas, speeding up repetitive tasks, or drafting something quickly that I can then refine. But for tasks that need deep context, creativity, or sensitive decision-making, I’d rely on my own skills and judgment. AI is a great assistant, but it’s not a replacement for human thinking.

### Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI
To avoid leaning on AI too much, I’ll treat it as a starting point but not the final answer. I’ll always review, edit, and adapt AI-generated work so it fits the exact needs of the project. This way, my skills keep improving, and AI remains a tool, not a crutch.

### Ensuring Data Privacy When Using AI
I’ll never enter confidential company data, private user information, or anything that could be sensitive into AI tools. If I need to discuss something specific, I’ll anonymise the details so there’s no risk of exposing private information.

### One Best Practice I’ll Follow
Whenever I use AI, I’ll double-check the output for accuracy and relevance before sharing it. That means fact-checking, making sure it aligns with the project’s goals, and ensuring it sounds like something I would write, not just what the AI suggested.

### Example of Using AI and Critical Review

I used ChatGPT to help refine one of my sentences in this reflection. My original wording was:

“I would use AI when I need help brainstorming ideas, speeding up repetitive tasks, or drafting something quickly that I can then refine. But for tasks that need deep context, creativity, or sensitive decision-making, I’d rely on my own skills and judgment. AI is a great assistant, but it’s not a replacement for human thinking.”

The AI suggested simplifying the flow to make it easier to read:

“I use AI to brainstorm, speed up repetitive work, or draft something to polish later. For tasks that need deep context, creativity, or sensitive judgment, I rely on my own skills. AI is an assistant—not a replacement for human thinking.”

#### My Review:

Usefulness: The AI helped streamline the sentence, making it shorter and smoother.

Accuracy: The meaning stayed the same, which was important.

Edits I Made: I combined the clarity of the AI version with some of my original phrasing, so it still sounded like my voice.

Final Outcome: A polished, more concise reflection that balanced readability with my personal style.
