## Usability Test Findings & Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1
- **Feedback:** The colours and rounding of elements felt off and inconsistent with the rest of the app.
- **Action Taken:** Adjusted the colour palette to create better contrast and improved the corner rounding for a smoother, more cohesive appearance.

### Iteration 2
- **Feedback:** The layout felt too structured and rigid, which reduced the sense of flow in the design.
- **Action Taken:** Increased spacing between key components and refined alignment to make the interface feel lighter and more natural.

### Iteration 3
- **Feedback:** Some additional elements made the interface feel crowded.
- **Action Taken:** Removed unnecessary visual elements and left-aligned the playlist section to create a cleaner and more balanced layout.


## Supervisor & Founder Review
Both the **supervisor** and **founder** reviewed the final iteration. They appreciated the improved visual balance, simplified layout, and the overall polish achieved through the iterative refinements.

## Reflection
Each iteration helped move the prototype closer to a clean, intuitive, and visually cohesive design. The process highlighted how small aesthetic and structural adjustments can significantly improve user experience and visual appeal before final development.
