# UX User Interviews Reflection

## Reflection

### Telling the Difference Between a UX Problem and a Learning Curve
When a user struggles with a feature during testing, my first instinct would be to observe why they’re struggling. If they’re confused because the interface is unclear or the next step isn’t obvious, that’s a UX problem. But if they just need a moment to explore and then get it, it’s likely a learning curve. The trick is to watch for repeated patterns—if multiple users trip over the same thing, it’s probably a design issue that needs fixing.

### Avoiding Influencing User Responses
It’s easy to accidentally guide users with your tone or phrasing, so I’d make a conscious effort to stay neutral. That means asking open-ended questions like “What do you expect will happen next?” instead of “Do you see the button over here?” I’d also resist the urge to jump in when they hesitate—letting the silence stretch often gives more honest insights than leading them to the answer.

### Documenting Usability Testing Results
Good documentation should make sense to someone who wasn’t there in the room. I’d include the test goals, a quick overview of the participants, and key observations—both positive and negative. I’d also note direct quotes, because they capture the user’s experience in their own words. Finally, I’d organise findings into clear themes so the design team can easily connect feedback to specific areas of the product and make informed changes.
