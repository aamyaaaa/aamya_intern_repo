# UX Test Script – Focus Bear

## Introduction
Hi! Thanks for helping me with this test. The goal is to see how easy it is to use Focus Bear, not to test your skills. There are no wrong answers here. If something feels unclear or confusing, that’s exactly what I want to learn about.

## Scenario
Imagine you just downloaded Focus Bear for the first time.  
Your task is to set up a focus session that will help you work on something important without distractions.

## Instructions
- Please talk out loud as you go so I can understand what you’re thinking.
- I won’t help unless you’re completely stuck—this is to see how you naturally try to use the app.

## Follow-up Questions
1. What was the easiest part of setting up the session?
2. Was anything confusing or unclear?
3. Did you feel like you always knew what to do next?
4. How did the design make you feel while using it?
5. If you could change one thing about the process, what would it be?
