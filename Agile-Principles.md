# Agile Principles Reflection

## Reflection

### Biggest Benefits of Agile
Agile keeps things flexible and responsive. Instead of locking into a big, rigid plan, the team can adapt based on what’s actually happening. This means we can deliver value faster, fix problems sooner, and make sure the work we’re doing is always aligned with real needs. It also encourages more collaboration and open communication, which makes the whole process smoother.

### Biggest Challenges of Agile
One of the hardest parts is that Agile requires constant communication and discipline. If the team isn’t updating boards, sharing progress, or adjusting priorities, it can fall apart quickly. It also needs everyone to be comfortable with change—which can be tricky if people are used to traditional project management.

### How Agile Principles Can Improve My Role
Agile reminds me to focus on delivering small, meaningful pieces of work regularly rather than waiting to launch something big all at once. In my role, that means breaking tasks into smaller steps, getting feedback sooner, and making adjustments quickly instead of letting issues pile up.

### Scrum vs. Kanban 
Scrum works in fixed-length sprints, with defined roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner. It’s more structured and has regular ceremonies like sprint planning and retrospectives.  
Kanban is more flexible—it’s all about visualising work on a board, limiting work in progress, and moving tasks through the process as capacity allows.  
Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it suits a continuous flow of work without the need for time-boxed sprints.

### One Agile Principle That Will Be Most Useful to Me
“Responding to change over following a plan.” This keeps me from feeling stuck if something shifts—I can adapt my work quickly instead of wasting time forcing a plan that no longer fits.
