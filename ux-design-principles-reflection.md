### Maintaining a Minimal, Distraction-Free UI with Powerful Features
The key is to offer complexity only when the user wants it. Focus Bear can keep its interface calm and clutter-free by showing only the most essential elements upfront, while tucking advanced features into secondary menus or settings panels. This way, neurodivergent users aren’t overwhelmed, but power users can still access the depth they need without friction.

### Balancing Aesthetics and Usability
If a design change looks great but makes the product harder to use, usability will always win. A beautiful design that frustrates the user defeats the purpose of the product. People would download for the aesthetics but delete rate would be much faster. The ideal approach is to revisit the change and see if there’s a way to preserve its visual appeal without sacrificing functionality—compromise is possible when aesthetics serve the experience, not replace it.

### Risks of Overloading Users with Choices
Too many options can cause decision fatigue, confusion, and abandonment—especially for neurodivergent users who may prefer clear, guided pathways. To avoid this, Focus Bear should prioritise defaults, reduce unnecessary settings, and use progressive disclosure so users only see more choices when they actively seek them out. This keeps the experience light, predictable, and confidence-building.
