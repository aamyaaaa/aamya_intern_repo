# Agile Roles Reflection

## Reflection

### My Role in the Agile Process
As a UX designer, my main focus is to make sure the product is intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable to use. In the Agile process, that means working closely with the team to turn ideas into clear, user-friendly designs, testing them early, and refining them based on feedback. I help bridge the gap between the user’s needs and the technical side of development, so what we build isn’t just functional—it’s genuinely helpful and easy to use.

### How My Responsibilities Interact with Other Roles
I work closely with developers to make sure designs are implemented accurately and maintain their intended usability. I also collaborate with the product manager to align design work with business goals and priorities. With QA, I ensure that the user experience remains consistent and smooth after new features are released.

### One Role I Frequently Collaborate With
I work a lot with developers. To improve teamwork, I can provide clearer design documentation in Figma, including annotations and interaction details, so they have fewer questions during implementation. Regular check-ins during development also help us catch and fix small issues before they become big problems.
